# Development

Using react router template, readme for dev is therefore same as here: https://github.com/remix-run/react-router-templates/tree/main/cloudflare (except using `pnpm` instead of `npm` and `pnpm dev` runs `vite dev` because i like using console ninja and react router is not supported yet)
